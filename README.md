## 📦 What is Dragons and Dark?

Dragons and Dark is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that aims to strengthen the player in various ways. It also adds a variety of new bosses, blocks, armor, structures, and comes with unique mechanics for each mob. This makes the experience more than just expanding the ways to become stronger and thus complicating survival a bit.
